# airbnb-clone
This project is built while learning Reac.js from [Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com)
Used TailwindCSS for styling and referred so much online to style my page (ðŸ¤« figuring out code for styling is a waste of time)

## NavBar
Made in a single component. It's static

## Hero Section
Made with a single component, it just has a Hero image and a small paragraph

## Experiences Section
It has experience of various people as cards whose data is dynamic, so rendered dynanically using Props from the dummy data file [data.js](https://github.com/sri-nivas1227/airbnb-clone/blob/main/src/components/data.js) file
Currently working on introducing a badge on the cards to show the course is SOLD OUT
